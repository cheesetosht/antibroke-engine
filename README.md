This App can prevents you from being broke by keeping track of your income & expenses.

## The Idea
In school, we're never made taught of a very crucial concept called Personal Finance despite the fact that everyone had to have that skill no matter what. Hence, the main idea behind creating the project was to build something that comes to keep track of personal finance.

## Future of Anti-Broke Engine
We look forward to adding up a very unique feature that can suggest options for creating channels of money so that you can become financially independent within a period of time.
It'll drop suggestions based on your financial activities & standing. It'll tell you how & where you should invest money so that it earns you more money.

## About the App
The WebApp is built using React.js & Sass. It is a custom design, created from scratch by us during the project.
